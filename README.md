# 🤖 AI Through Decisions and Judgments: A Two-Semester Exploration

This repository contains code, projects, and notes from a rigorous year-long artificial intelligence course focused on two complementary themes: **decision-making** and **judgment-making**. The course weaves together classical AI fundamentals and modern machine learning techniques through hands-on algorithm development, culminating in deep neural networks and real-world tools.

## 🧠 Semester 1: AI as Decision-Making

The first half of the course focuses on modeling intelligence through the lens of **sequential decision trees** — from search algorithms to game-playing agents. These problems form the roots of symbolic AI, and are still foundational in modern fields like robotics, planning, and optimization.

### 🛠 Unit 0: Python Mastery
Before diving into algorithms, we established fluency in idiomatic Python — not just syntax, but expressive constructs like:
- Tuple unpacking and packing for multi-value returns
- Comprehensions (`list`, `set`, `dict`) for elegant iteration
- `enumerate()` and control flow shortcuts for cleaner logic
- Performance-aware use of data structures (`heapq`, `deque`, etc.)

### 🔍 Unit 1: Search Algorithms
Classical search techniques for pathfinding and exploration, including:
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Iterative Deepening Search
- A* Search with heuristics  
**Projects:** solving the 15-puzzle, generating word ladders, and exploring search tree efficiency.

### 🧩 Unit 2: Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)
AI’s approach to solving massively interdependent variables, with algorithms like:
- Backtracking with constraint propagation
- Forward checking
- Arc consistency (AC-3)  
**Projects:** solving hundreds of Sudoku puzzles, generalized N-Queens optimization.

### 🎲 Unit 3: Adversarial Games
Decision-making in competitive environments via:
- Minimax and Negamax algorithms
- Alpha-Beta pruning for efficiency
- Heuristic evaluation functions  
**Projects:** building AIs for Tic-Tac-Toe and Othello, with AI-vs-AI tournaments.

### 🚀 Unit 4: Capstone Project
Final project extending a prior unit:
- Network pathfinding with weighted edges (e.g., Amtrak rail system)
- Procedural crossword generator via CSP
- Adversarial AI for complex turn-based games

## 🧠 Semester 2: AI as Judgment-Making

The second half pivots to **classification** and **learning** — how computers categorize new data based on structure (unsupervised) or training (supervised). This semester bridges traditional AI and machine learning, ending with deep neural networks.

### 🔤 Unit 5: Regular Expressions
A study in symbolic pattern recognition:
- Complex pattern matching
- Regex compiler design  
**Projects:** problem sets and custom regex engine implementation.

### 🧬 Unit 6: Genetic Algorithms
Search through mutation and crossover:
- Fitness evaluation
- Genetic diversity and selection  
**Projects:** decrypting substitution ciphers, evolving Tetris bots.

### 🌌 Unit 7: k-Means Clustering
Unsupervised learning:
- Vector quantization
- Cluster optimization via Euclidean distance  
**Projects:** color quantization in images, classifying stars without labeled data.

### 🌳 Unit 8: Decision Trees
Supervised learning using discrete attribute splits:
- Entropy, information gain, pruning  
**Projects:** mushroom toxicity classification, pattern mining from datasets.

### 🧠 Unit 9: Neural Networks
The core of modern AI:
- Derivation of perceptrons and multilayer networks
- Backpropagation from scratch
- Feedforward computation  
**Projects:** logic gates → functions → MNIST digit classification using a self-coded neural net.

### 🛠 Unit 10: Modern Libraries
Hands-on with:
- `nltk` for text processing
- `fast.ai` for abstraction over PyTorch  
**Outcome:** exposure to modern toolkits and springboards for independent study.

## 🎓 Final Thoughts

This course provides both **historical grounding** in the origins of AI and **hands-on experience** with contemporary tools. From building your own Sudoku solver or Othello AI from scratch, to training a neural net to classify handwritten digits, this curriculum cultivates the kind of mastery and intuition needed for modern AI research or development.

Whether symbolic or statistical, search-based or learned — AI is ultimately about intelligent behavior. This course delivers both the theory and the toolkit to engineer it.
